# Music-in-Motion
Accessible music game where a motion sensor is hooked up to a wheelchair.  When the wheelchair is in motion, music plays, and players will dance.  When the music stops, the players should stop moving; otherwise, they are out.  The goal of the game is to facilitate communication and friendship between able bodied children and non-able bodied children.
