# Music-in-Motion
Music in motion is an accessible music game used to facilitate communication and friendship between able bodied children and non-able bodied children.  A motion sensor is hooked up to a wheelchair (probably by the wheels).  When the wheelchair is in motion, music plays, and players will dance.  When the music stops, the players should stop moving; otherwise, they are out.
